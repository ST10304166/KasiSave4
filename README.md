Kasisave is a user-friendly Android application designed to help individuals manage their personal finances efficiently. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for tracking expenses, viewing income summaries, and customizing appearance settings, all while maintaining data privacy through local storage using Room Database. Upon launching the app, users can sign up or log in and are immediately directed to the Dashboard screen, which displays an overview of their total balance, monthly budget, and recorded expenses. From here, users can navigate to add new expenses, access income details, or customize app preferences through the settings page.
The Add Expense screen allows users to log financial entries by specifying the amount, selecting a category, choosing the date, and optionally attaching a photo or fileâ€”ideal for storing receipt images. These entries are stored locally using the Room Persistence Library, ensuring secure and private data management without needing internet access.
In the Settings section, users can enable or disable dark mode, which dynamically changes the CardView background to black and text to white in real time. The settings screen also allows users to choose their preferred currency, toggle daily budget notifications, and includes a placeholder button for backing up their data in future updates. The interface is clean and consistent, with a back button in the top-right corner of the settings screen that returns the user to the dashboard.
The application is developed using Kotlin and Android Jetpack components, targeting Android 12 and above. It prioritizes offline functionality and simplicity, making it suitable for users who want a straightforward tool to track personal spending. Planned enhancements include cloud backup, biometric login, and analytical reports to further empower users in achieving their financial goals.
